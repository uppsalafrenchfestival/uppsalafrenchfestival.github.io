<span class="name"> Synopsis:</span> <br/>
<span class="resumefilm">  All is calm in this little village in the center of France until the fairground entertainers arrive with their trailers. Then the fair gets under way: carousel, lottery, brass band and a traveling cinema where François, the local postman, discovers a film about the American postal service. Encouraged by the whole village, he sets out to deliver the mail "American Style". </span>
