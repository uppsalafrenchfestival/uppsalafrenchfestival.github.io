<span class="name"> Synopsis:</span> <br/>
<span class="resumefilm"> Clément, a young philosophy teacher from Paris is sent to Arras for a year. He meets Jennifer, a pretty hair-stylist, who becomes his lover. They're free in their hearts and bodies and could share this perfect love if the cultural and social divide were not as deep. </span>
