<span class="name"> Synopsis:</span> <br/>
<span class="resumefilm"> A documentary teen-movie, poetic, funny and formidable, Swagger carries us in the midst of the astonishing minds of eleven teenagers growing up in one of the most underprivileged neighbourhood in France. Despite their life difficulties, Aulnay's kids have dreams and ambitions. And noone will take that from them! </span>
