		The festival is organized by the french Alliance of Uppsala. More infos about the association can be found <a href="https://af-upsal.org/" target="_blank">here </a>. It is a worldwide association founded in Paris in 1883. Only eight years later in 1891, the French Alliance of Uppsala was formed. It is completely free from political or religious affiliation and aims to promote interest in the French language and the culture of French-speaking countries. </p>

		<p> L'Alliance Fran√ßaise offers a rich and varied program. You do not have to be perfect in French to participate. Some activities are entirely in Swedish. Everyone interested is welcome! </p>
