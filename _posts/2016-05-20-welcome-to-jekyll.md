You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

<!--Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:-->

<!--{% highlight ruby %}-->
<!--def print_hi(name)-->
<!--  puts "Hi, #{name}"-->
<!--end-->
<!--print_hi('Tom')-->
<!--#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.-->
<!--{% endhighlight %}-->
